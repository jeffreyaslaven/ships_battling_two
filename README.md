# Ships Battling Two
The new and improved sequel to the original "Ships Battling"

# What is new?
* Optimized and organized code
* A new difficulty selector

# Requirements to run
* Python installed on your machine

# Difficulties and what they mean
* Easy: The CPU will make mistakes in its guesses. CPU ship placement is predictable and is pattern based.
* Medium: The CPU will NOT make mistakes in its guesses but will be random. CPU ship placement is NOT predictable.
* Hard: The CPU will NOT make mistakes and will use an algorithm for its guesses. CPU is much more confident in its guesses, its language will reflect this. CPU ship placement is NOT predictable.

# How to run
Go to main.py and run file in your CLI of choice that has Python available
